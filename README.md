## Libraries/frameworks used:
 - Vue.js
 - Vuetify - UI component library
 - Lodash - helper functions

## How does it work?
The app uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the fastest path from bus stop a to bus stop b. The UI was made using Vue.js and Vuetify UI component library for rapid development. (and because I love Vue)
